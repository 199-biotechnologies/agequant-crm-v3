- `/components/invoices/invoice-columns.tsx`: Now uses `StatusBadge` component and `InvoiceStatus` type
- `/components/quotes/quote-columns.tsx`: Now uses `StatusBadge` component and `QuoteStatus` type

### 2. Centralized Supabase Client

- `/app/quotes/actions.ts`: Updated to use the centralized client
- `/app/products/actions.ts`: Updated to use the centralized client
- `/app/customers/actions.ts`: Updated to use the centralized client

### 3. Status Badge Component

**New File Created**:
- `/components/ui/status-badge.tsx`: Reusable badge component for all entity statuses

**Files Updated**:
- `/components/invoices/invoice-columns.tsx`: Now uses the StatusBadge component
- `/components/quotes/quote-columns.tsx`: Now uses the StatusBadge component

### 4. Table Skeleton Components

**New Files Created**:
- `/components/ui/table-skeleton.tsx`: Generic and entity-specific skeleton loaders

**Files Updated/Created**:
- `/components/invoices/invoice-table-skeleton.tsx`: Now uses the generic skeleton
- `/components/quotes/quote-table-skeleton.tsx`: Created to use the generic skeleton
- `/components/customers/customer-table-skeleton.tsx`: Created to use the generic skeleton
- `/components/products/product-table-skeleton.tsx`: Created to use the generic skeleton

## Tier 2 Refactorings

### 1. Standardized Error Handling

**New File Created**:
- `/lib/utils/error-handler.ts`: Centralized error handling utilities

**Files Updated**:
- `/app/invoices/actions.ts`: Now uses standardized error handling
- `/app/quotes/actions.ts`: Now uses standardized error handling
- `/app/products/actions.ts`: Now uses standardized error handling

### 2. Form Layout Components

**New File Created**:
- `/components/ui/form-layout.tsx`: Reusable form layout components

**Files Updated**:
- `/components/customers/customer-form.tsx`: Now uses the form layout components

### 3. Form Field Components

**New File Created**:
- `/components/ui/form-fields.tsx`: Reusable form field components

**Files Updated**:
- `/components/customers/customer-form.tsx`: Now uses the form field components

### 4. Centralized Schema Components

**New File Created**:
- `/lib/schemas/financial-documents.ts`: Shared schemas for invoices and quotes

**Files Updated**:
- `/app/invoices/actions.ts`: Now uses the shared schemas
- `/app/quotes/actions.ts`: Now uses the shared schemas

## Implementation Impact

These refactorings have provided numerous benefits to the codebase:

1. **Reduced Code Duplication**: The amount of duplicated code has been significantly reduced across the application.

2. **Improved Type Safety**: Enhanced type definitions and shared schemas promote more consistent, type-safe code.

3. **Better Organization**: Related functionality is now grouped together in logical locations.

4. **Enhanced Maintainability**: Changes to common elements can be made in one place instead of across multiple files.

5. **Consistent UI**: Components like status badges and table skeletons now have a consistent appearance.

6. **Simplified Form Implementation**: Form creation is now more straightforward with reusable layouts and fields.

7. **More Robust Error Handling**: Standardized error handling improves both the developer and user experience.

## Remaining Work

While significant progress has been made, some refactoring opportunities remain:

1. **Update More Forms**: Apply the form layout and field components to other entity forms.

2. **Settings Actions**: Update the settings-related action files to use the centralized Supabase client and error handling.

3. **Form Data Parsing Utilities**: Create shared utilities for parsing complex form data.

4. **Implement Tier 3 Refactorings**: Move on to the more complex refactorings identified in the prioritization document.

These changes have laid a solid foundation for future enhancements and maintenance of the codebase.
