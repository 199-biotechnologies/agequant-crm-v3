# Tier 1 Refactoring Summary

This document summarizes the Tier 1 (low-risk, high-reward) refactorings that have been implemented.

## 1. Centralized Constants

**File Created**: `/lib/constants.ts`

A central location for shared constants used throughout the application:
- Currency definitions
- Product units and statuses
- Invoice and quote statuses

**Files Updated**:
- `/components/customers/customer-form-schema.ts`
- `/components/products/product-form-schema.ts`
- `/components/invoices/invoice-columns.tsx`
- `/components/quotes/quote-columns.tsx`

**Benefits**:
- Eliminated duplicate code
- Ensures consistency across the application
- Provides TypeScript types for status values
- Makes future changes to supported values easier

## 2. Centralized Supabase Client

**File Created**: `/lib/supabase/server-client.ts`

A shared utility for creating the Supabase client in server actions:
- Encapsulates cookie handling and configuration
- Provides a consistent way to initialize the client

**Files Updated**:
- `/app/customers/actions.ts`

**Files Remaining to Update**:
- `/app/products/actions.ts`
- `/app/invoices/actions.ts`
- `/app/quotes/actions.ts`
- `/app/settings/app-settings.actions.ts`
- `/app/settings/issuing-entities.actions.ts`
- `/app/settings/payment-sources.actions.ts`

**Benefits**:
- Eliminates duplicate client initialization code
- Makes configuration changes easier
- Improves consistency and maintainability

## 3. Reusable Status Badge Component

**File Created**: `/components/ui/status-badge.tsx`

A unified component for displaying status badges:
- Handles styling based on status value and entity type
- Supports invoice, quote, and product statuses
- Provides consistent appearance across the application

**Files Updated**:
- `/components/invoices/invoice-columns.tsx`
- `/components/quotes/quote-columns.tsx`

**Benefits**:
- Eliminates duplicate styling code
- Ensures visual consistency
- Makes status styling changes easier to maintain
- Reduces the likelihood of styling inconsistencies

## 4. Generic Table Skeleton Component

**File Created**: `/components/ui/table-skeleton.tsx`

A reusable skeleton loader for tables:
- Configurable columns and row count
- Type-specific skeleton styles (badge, text, button, etc.)
- Pre-configured skeletons for each entity type

**Files Updated**:
- `/components/invoices/invoice-table-skeleton.tsx`

**Benefits**:
- Provides consistent loading states
- Makes it easy to add skeletons for other entities
- Ensures visual consistency across loading states
- Simplifies the creation of new table components

## Next Steps

These refactorings provide a solid foundation for further code improvements. The next steps should focus on:

1. Updating the remaining server action files to use the centralized Supabase client

2. Adding skeleton components for other entity tables:
   - Quotes
   - Customers
   - Products

3. Moving to Tier 2 refactorings:
   - Standardizing error handling
   - Creating form layout components
   - Centralizing schema components

These changes have improved the maintainability of the codebase while preserving existing functionality, making it easier to implement new features and fix bugs going forward.
